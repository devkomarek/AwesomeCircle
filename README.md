## Description:
Awesome Circle is an arcade game, made entirely by one person. The game consist of 5 very demanding levels. Sit down, feel the music and get into the spirit - each level has its own special piece of music. The game is based on a few simple rules, yet it can be a quite exciting challenge for a player. Grab your phone, run the game and try to spend around 60 seconds to unlock the next level. Sounds simple, doesn't it? By using the touch screen potential, the controls are more intuitive - to hit just touch the screen anywhere. Shoot the incoming flying circles to prevent them from reaching the center of the screen. Don't worry if you lose. Being defeated is an inseparable element of the gameplay. It is a process of acquiring skill and getting better at concentration. Over time, your skills will surely transcend opportunities of the game. For this purpose a special mode has been prepared, which allows you to finish the game once again, this time with even more difficult levels. This mode is prepared for the most demanding players and it doesn't leave any room for errors.
